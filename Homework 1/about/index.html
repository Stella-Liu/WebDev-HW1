		<p>Hello... I am the awkward child who can't sit still and is pretty quiet around unfamilar people. I tend to use the name tearykin when I do anything online, teary for the tears that I cry and kin for a friendly fellow. Umm... I like reading manga and doing random things... I also did blog last year using weebly, but it loads really slow, so I switched to wordpress around summer time. Sorry teacher about not saying that I did blog before...</p>
