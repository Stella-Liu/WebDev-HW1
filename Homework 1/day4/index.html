		<p>Today in class...

			<p>Teacher: (Walks into the classroom holding a stack of paper)</p>

			<p>Teacher: Clear your desks.</p>

			<p>Me: (inside my mind) No! It..it..it can't be!</p>

			<p>Teacher: We will have a pop quiz today.</p>

			<p>Me: (starts praying) Please don't be on the topic I was suppose to do for homework.</p>

			<p>Teacher: Don't worry. This pop quiz is really easy.</p>

			<p>Me: (my head pops up) Really? (looking at him hopefully)</p>

			<p>Teacher: It is almost the same as the homework you were assigned to do. So if you did understand the homework, you should do very well.</p>

			<p>Me: (rain cloud above my head) He he he he... Yeah...</p>

			<p>After the surprise pop quiz...</p>
